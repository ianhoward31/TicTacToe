# TicTacToe
Prerequisits: Visual Studio 2019 Community with C++ Developer Package (Free)
Summary: A classic game of tic tac toe PvP. Each player is prompted to enter coordinates on their turn. The source code is set up to follow the same rules 
of Tic Tac Toe. If users enter incorrect coordinates or try to steal each others spots the code will recognize and prevent this using do/for loops and 
boolean logic until a winner is determined.
Instructions: Open the Source.cpp in Visual Studio and select the Green Arrow at the top that says "Local Windows Debugger"
